1. Unit hypercube with random hyper-rectangle obstacles
2. N = 10^5 vertices (Halton sequence)
3. O = 10^4 obstacles
4. Start = [0.25,0.25,..]
5. Goal = [0.75,0.75,..]
6. Obstacle Coverage of Config Space = ~80%
5. V_0 for vertex batching - 100 vertices
6. Inflation factor for vertices - 2x after each batch
7. r_0 for edge batching - 3 * N^(-1/d)
8. Inflation factor for edge batching - 2 ^ (1/4)
